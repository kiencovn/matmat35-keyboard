# matmat35
matmat35 is my first handwired keyboard design which has QAZ 11u and HHKB layout.
STLs files were designed for 3d printing only, must be modified before milling. The controller mount was design for a promicro with type-C connector, which has longer pcb than traditional pro-micro.

Trivia : The board is named after my girlfriend's nickname, after flipped. The flower pattern in the bottom is rangoon creeper, one of her favorites.
