# matmat35
matmat35 is a handwired keyboard design which has QAZ 11u and HHKB layout.
STLs files were designed for 3d printing only, must be modified before milling. The controller mount was design for a promicro with type-C connector, which has longer pcb than traditional pro-micro. My first design, so no wireless connection in mind, yet.

Trivia : The board is named after my girlfriend's nickname, which is flipped. The flower pattern in the bottom part is rangoon creeper, one of our favorites.
