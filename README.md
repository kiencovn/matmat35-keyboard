# matmat35
matmat35 is my first handwired keyboard design which has QAZ 11u layout.
STLs files were designed for 3d printing only, must be modified before milling.

Trivia : The board is named after my girlfriend's nickname, after flipped. The flower pattern in the bottom is rangoon creeper, one of her favorites.
