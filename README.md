# matmat35
matmat35 is a handwired keyboard design which has QAZ 11u and HHKB layout.
STL files were designed for 3d printing only, and must be modified in case of milling. The controller mount (body21.stl) was design for a promicro with type-C connector, which has a slightly longer pcb than traditional micro usb promicro controller. This is my first design, so no wireless connection in mind, yet.

Trivia : The board is named after my girl's nickname, which is flipped. The flower pattern in the bottom part is rangoon creeper, one of our favorites.
